StekenWood Solutions was founded through the strategic alliance of two highly specialized and complementary entities: Gang del Bosco and Stechem Lab.

Gang del Bosco, with over ten years of experience in full-stack web development, has built a strong reputation for delivering reliable and scalable digital infrastructures. Its core expertise lies in PHP-based architectures, MySQL database engineering, and the design of custom management systems. The group is known for its hands-on, craftsmanship-driven approach to software, capable of translating complex operational demands into robust and maintainable applications.

Stechem Lab developed as a research-oriented unit focused on computational intelligence. Its strengths include data analysis, predictive modeling, machine-learning pipelines, and backend engineering for high-performance environments. Over the years, Stechem Lab has contributed to intelligent systems for healthcare, research, and digital production, always guided by methodological rigor and scientific clarity.

The convergence of these two technical cultures led to the creation of StekenWood Solutions—a company where classical web engineering meets advanced data science. This integration makes it possible to deliver end-to-end digital ecosystems: tailored web platforms, resilient backend architectures, data-driven decision systems, and embedded AI models.

StekenWood Solutions stands as a unique technological partner: grounded in the solidity of traditional coding, strengthened by modern computational intelligence, and driven by an ethos of quality, transparency, and long-term innovation.
